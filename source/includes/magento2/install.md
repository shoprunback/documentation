# Installing the Module

## 1. Create your own ShopRunBack account

	First of all, you must create your own ShopRunBack account here. [here](https://sso.shoprunback.com/en/users/sign_up)

	For your store configuration, please contact your account manager who will guide you through the process 

## 2. Download ShopRunBack public PHP library
	[Click here](https://github.com/shoprunback/shoprunback-php/releases/latest) to download the library. 
	Then, unzip the .zip and move the folder into your project directory **magento_root/lib/**

## 3. How to get the Module

	Contact the ShopRunBack Team to get the source code of the module or you can download from [here](https://github.com/shoprunback/magento2-module/releases/tag/v1.0)

First, you should copy it’s code to the required directory (project_name/app/code):

## 4. Install Command line

Magento CLI provides a large number of useful console commands to manage the store. And you can get the list of these commands by running: php bin/magento. But now we need to use only one:

php bin/magento setup:upgrade

### FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

Copy module code to to the required directory: (app/code/ ) and run following command 

php -dmemory_limit=20G bin/magento setup:upgrade

php -dmemory_limit=20G bin/magento setup:di:compile

php -dmemory_limit=20G bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f

php bin/magento cache:flush && php bin/magento cache:clean (For clean catch)
