# Inventory App for retailers

The inventory app is a mobile app (iOS and Android) to manage your warehouse's incoming inventory.

As a retailer, it is a long and hard process to identify and sort every incoming parcels. With this app, you're only a download away from having an easy-to-use and reliable incoming inventory management application.

With this application, you will be able to see what's coming to your local warehouse, giving you a head's up when there are a lot of parcels to process.

You'll also be able to scan your incoming parcels. By doing so, you will set a definitive tracking for the parcel and we will be able to notify your customer that you have received the package he returned. With the scan, we update the position of the items and you have a clear knowledge of your total number of returns.

And of course your customers will be happier, knowing their package has been correctly returned!

We recommend you to use this application as it is part of our technologic ecosystem. By using it, you provide us with useful data we can use to better our services and provide you with even more awesome features like this one.

It is currently available in English and French.
